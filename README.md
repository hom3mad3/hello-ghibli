## Hello Ghibli üçô

This is a small project built to play with the [ghibli api](ghibliapi.herokuapp.com)

I'm using [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg), a minimalist [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) setup, [react](https://github.com/facebook/react), vanilla css and [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) to fetch the data from the api.

`$ yarn && yarn start` should get you up and running on `localhost`
